# CIT 480
This entire repository is created for my weekly blog entries for my CIT 480 senior Design class of Fall 2019.

Every week I will create another blogpost using html and also a bootstrap template. The blog entries will be explaining what I did throughout the week in relation to this class.

This repository has all the code needed for this site.
