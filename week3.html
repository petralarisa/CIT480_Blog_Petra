				<h2>September, 13 2019</h2>
				<p>This week is the third week of fall semester 2019.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Monday, I learned about how to deal with slackers in my group. I learned that in any group there's 10 percents chances that someone would be the social loafer. I'm really glad that we covered this because it is very essential for collaborative work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to learn R&D again. This time, we were divided into groups and using the concept of agile and scrum, we had a project to produce as much paper airplanes as possible. We did 4 sprints in total. We started with design phase where we need to come up with a strategy and planned on how we were gonna fold the paper. Each person was only allowed to make one fold at a time then the paperplane had to be passed on to the next person. Throughout the sprints, we managed to produce consistently between 10 to 11 paperplane. The first two sprints I was the one who lead but for those two sprints, all of our products failed the testing phase. For the third sprint, we made a switch of role. My teammate noticed that other groups had a different design with less surface area meanwhile our paperplanes had a pretty wide surface area. So for the third sprint, my teammate took over and created a brand new design. We managed to improve by having a 50% success rate on the testing phase. And then for the last sprint, every group got a new scrum master so my friend moved to a different group while we got a new scrum master. This last sprint, we figured out that our new scrum master had the same design as out third sprint but this time he also told us the secret on how to throw the paperplanes so that our products could all passed the testing phase. This last sprint, we had a pretty good turnout by having 8/10 successful products. This really taught me the benefit of working in an agile environment with a scrum master. We can always change the scrum master as needed when out turnout isn't looking good and when we have a change in out team, the dynamic of our team would also change. I also learned that a tight timeframe forces me to be more efficient and productive cause there is no room for any procrastination.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Wednesday, we continued to talk more about the agile and scrum methodology. I really like this approach a lot compared to the traditional waterfall approach because it really increases the efficiency.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Thursday, I also learned another new skill. I learned about version controls and the esential git commands that will help me a lot in my upcoming projects. </p>
