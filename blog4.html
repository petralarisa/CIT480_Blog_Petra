        <h3>LINUX File Systems</h3>
        <p>In LINUX, everything is pretty much files. In organizing all these files, there is always a directory which holds files and also other sub-directories. The way it is managed can be illustrated as a tree structure. There’s the top level directory which is called the <strong>root<strong> directory. This root directory is usually represented by the forward slash symbol or ‘/’. Right under root, there are some main subdirectories that are just one level under the root directories and each of these directories contains some special files and has a specific content. You can see the illustration of the most common LINUX file system layout. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="FS-layout.png" style = "width:600px">
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Here are the specific contents of each of these subdirectories of the root directory* :</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>/bin</strong> consists of common programs shared by the system, system administrator, and also the user</li>
            <li><strong>/boot</strong> consists of the startup files in the kernel. It is also where you can find the GRand Unified Bootloader (<strong>GRUB</strong>)</li>
            <li><strong>/dev</strong> contains the reference to all of the CPU peripheral hardwares</li>
            <li><strong>/etc</strong> Most important system configuration files are in /etc, this directory contains data similar to those in the Control Panel in Windows</li>
            <li><strong>/home</strong> is the Home directories of the common users.</li>
            <li><strong>/initrd</strong> (on some distributions) is the Information for booting. Do not remove!</li>
            <li><strong>/lib</strong> contains the Library files, includes files for all kinds of programs needed by the system and the users.</li>
            <li><strong>/lost+found</strong> Every partition has a lost+found in its upper directory. Files that were saved during failures are here.</li>
            <li><strong>/home</strong> is the Home directories of the common users.</li>
            <li><strong>/misc</strong> is the directories for miscellaneous purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>/mnt</strong> is the Standard mount point for external file systems</li>
            <li><strong>/net</strong> is the Standard mount point for entire remote file systems</li>
            <li><strong>/opt</strong> contains extra and third party software.</li>
            <li><strong>/proc</strong> is a virtual file system containing information about system resources. </li>
            <li><strong>/root</strong> The administrative user's home directory. Mind the difference between /, the root directory and /root, the home directory of the <strong>root user</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>/sbin</strong> Programs for use by the system and the system administrator.</li>
            <li><strong>/tmp</strong> Temporary space for use by the system, cleaned upon reboot, so don't use this for saving any work!</li>
            <li><strong>/usr</strong> contains Programs, libraries, documentation etc. for all user-related programs.</li>
            <li><strong>/var</strong> stores all variable files and temporary files created by users, such as log files, the mail queue, the print spooler area, space for temporary storage of files downloaded from the Internet, or to keep an image of a CD before burning it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some useful commands relating to file systems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>pwd</strong>: this command is to show the path of your current working directory</li>
            <li><strong>ls</strong>: this command is to list all files within the directory you’re working on right now</li>
            <li><strong>cd</strong>: this command is to change directory and is usually followed by the path of the directory you want to change to</li>
          </ul>
