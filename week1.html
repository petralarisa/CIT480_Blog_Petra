				<h2>August, 30 2019</h2>
				<p>This week is the first week of fall semester 2019.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Monday, Professor Fitzgerald went over the syllabus.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Tuesday, I figured out that we will be working together along with compsci senior design class for 2 weeks. I got assigned to be in group 3 and we were assigned to build a prototype and present it next week on Thursday. This time we were just mapping our idea and deciding on what type of product we are going to create. We came up with the idea to create a private online marketplace similar to craigslist that is limited to only those who have affiliation to CSUN. Our focus is to provide a safe and secure alternative to craigslist or facebook marketplace.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Wednesday, each of us in our group drew our idea on paper and we went around sharing our thoughts about each other's ideas. We provided some feedback for each other and note down the feedbacks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Thursday, we had to vote on which ideas we are going to use for our prototype and we ended it by creating a storyboard.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Friday, I did the prereqs lab. I installed docker, set it up and also I was able to create a docker image and run it. I also created a repository for this blog on github and created this site.</p>
