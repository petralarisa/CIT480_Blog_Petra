# CIT480_blog

This entire repository is created for my weekly blog entries for my CIT 480 senior Design class of Fall 2019.

Every week I will be posting a blog using Jekyll. The blog entries will be explaining what I did throughout the week in relation to this class.

This repository has all the code generated using hugo however I can not integrate it to githubpages. 

To see the blog post content, please check the post file inside the _post folder.
